## Concepts Covered

### 1. Modals, Controllers, and Views
- Separation of concerns ensures a modular architecture.
- Models handle data, Controllers process user requests, and Views render responses.

### 2. Dynamic Templating
- EJS templates dynamically generate HTML based on data passed by the server.

### 3. Middlewares
- Custom and built-in middleware functions process incoming requests efficiently.

### 4. Request, Response, and Next Objects
- Comprehensive handling of HTTP requests, server responses, and middleware chaining.

### 5. Express Server
- The backbone of the application, enabling fast and scalable web development.

### 6. Handling GET and POST Requests
- GET for data retrieval and POST for data submission with appropriate validation.

### 7. Query Parameters
- Robust handling of query strings for dynamic routing and parameterized requests.
